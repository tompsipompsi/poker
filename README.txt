This program creates a shuffled deck of 52 cards, picks three 
hands from the deck each containing five cards, and analyzes 
these hands for the following poker hands: two pairs, straight, 
flush and straight flush.

In addition to features mentioned above I included small set of
unit tests to make sure that certain functions work correctly.
This was huge help during the development and makes it easy to 
check the correct behavior of the program.

When developing this program I kept in mind the possibility to
extend this program to cover all poker hands, and further
developing this program should be relatively easy.

This program was created with Python 3.6.4.
